Iâ€™m an instructor for the Master of Data Science program at the University of British Columbia. A computer engineer turned out to be a researcher with a strong passion for teaching all in my journey. My research interests are at the intersection of computer science and genomics. My research work primarily focussed on developing various computational solutions to accelerate the analysis of large-scale BioResource data.

With my industry experience, I always think about the perspective outside of the academic box, and my teachings are aligned on how students can be successful in the industry.
